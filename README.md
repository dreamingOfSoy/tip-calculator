# Tip Calculator

I made this tip calculator as my second independant project outside of two courses I took on JavaScript and HTML and CSS. The logic was built out by myself by using the notes I had taken, as well as searching for solutions on google.

The result is a very simple tip calculator where a user inputs specific values and then the calculator returns information, such as how much the bill + the tip is, and how much each person owes etc. There is also the option to receive the results to the nearest decimal to save awkward numbers.

This project mainly built on what I had learned from the JavaScript course, which was mostly the basics of functions, and some advanced DOM manipulation. For example, I could have just had the boxes already displayed, ready for the answers, but I chose to include a results section that pops in when the user clicks the 'calculate' button, with further results being added if the user inputs a number of people.
